# Open-source-research
A persistent knowledge base designed to grow over time. Open-sourcing my knowledge that others can also contribute to. Documenting what I did, problems I solved, and research areas I pursued.

Current research on AI, especially neural scaling laws of LLMs, along with other less-famous interpretability research on AI black box models and feature interpretation, is really very famous and widespread. I am actively pursuing this field of research, and intend to read and write a lot of things related to this topic in the future. 

This repository serves as a knowledge base for my documentation, and anyone else also interested in this field, who has their own views and opinions regarding this subject, are most welcome to fork this repo and contribute to it. 

Have an amazing research paper related to these topics that you want to popularize ?
Have great ideas that you want to open-source for others to also see and contribute to?
Then this repository is for you !
